# AI Prompts Used

## Algorithm design

- “Design a deterministic scheduling reflow algorithm that respects dependencies, non-overlap on work centers, shift windows, and maintenance windows. Provide a clean TypeScript structure.”

## Shift + maintenance time slicing

- “Given start time and required working minutes, calculate end time across working shifts and blocked maintenance intervals using Luxon.”

## Validation and edge cases

- “List edge cases: circular dependencies, missing parents, no shifts, maintenance blocks all time, conflicting locked maintenance work orders.”
